 ------ Exercise 7: Vive Paris 2024 ------

Objective:
- Write a C program to manage a dynamic list of participants for the Olympic Games. The program should:
- Define a struct to represent a participant.
- Use dynamic memory allocation to store a list of participants.
- Demonstrate adding participants to the list and listing all participants.

Notes:
Make a function to add an athlete to a list of recorded athletes and a function to list them all  (see expected output below).
- An athlete is represented by a name & a sport.
- All structs must be allocated dynamically. The array containing must also but (re)allocated dynamically as an entry is added.
- Don't forget about the memory you allocate ðŸ‘€

Key Concepts:
- Structs in C
- Dynamic memory allocation with malloc, realloc & free
- Handling arrays of structs

Architecture:
- olympic_participants.c file with a single main function, no header file necessary

Compilation:
- GCC with flags: -std=c99 -pedantic -Werror -Wall -Wextra -Wvla
