what does the 3 mean in printf(3)? Why is it important to specify this number? Did I need to specify it here?
	3 is conventions from the Unix Manual. There are 9 sections, the third section corresponds to Library calls. And printf comes from the Lib stdio. It's important to specify this number because sometimes there is more than 1 function in the different sections then we could have the wrong one (Example : write). Here you don't need to specify it because there is just one printf function. However it's always prefered to specify the section by protection.

        what does gracefully mean? Give examples of other "graceful" cases if you can think of any.
Gracefully mean that we need to handle the Error cases cleanly and simply with the tools provided by the system. (Like use try catch)
