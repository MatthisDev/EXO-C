 ------- Exercise 6: You're a wizard, Matthis -------

Objective :
	Write a C program to manage student records for Hogwarts School of Witchcraft
	and Wizardry. Don't use memory allocation, make it all static 
	(leave malloc & pointers alone).

The program should :
	- Define a struct to represent a student record.
	- Accept commands to add, list, and delete student records.
	- Store student records in an array of structs.
	- Handle errors gracefully.

Key Concepts :
	- Structs in C
	- Arrays of structs
	- Basic file I/O (optional for saving/loading records)
	- Command-line arguments
	- Input handling

Architecture :
	- hogwarts_records.c file, subfunctions are recommended!

Compilation :
	- GCC with flags: -std=c99 -pedantic -Werror -Wall -Wextra -Wvla

Supported Command List :
	- add <name> <house> <year> <gpa>: Adds a new student profile to the school
	records with given parameters
	- list: Prints all students in the school records (format can be seen below)
	- delete <index>: Deletes a specific entry by index
	- exit: Ends program.

Handle edge cases! What about missing parameters or invalid values?
