-------- Exercise 4: Roule buffer, roule --------

Objective :
	Write a C program that reads a file in blocks and prints each block 
	followed by a newline character on stdout. The program should take a filename 
	and the block size as command-line arguments.

	Don't use malloc for you temporary buffer (the buffer you will use to store 
	the content of the read syscall to write on stdout). Have a static fixed one 
		of size big enough (1024 is ok).

Key Concepts :
	- System calls (open(), read(), write(), close()) 
	- File descriptors
	- Error handling with errno
	- Command-line arguments
	- Buffer management

Architecture :
	block_reader.c file with a single main function, no header file necessary

Compilation :
	GCC with flags: -std=c99 -pedantic -Werror -Wall -Wextra -Wvla
