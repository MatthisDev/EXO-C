 ------- Exercise 5: Copycat -------

Objective :
	Write a C program that copies the content of one file to another. 
	The program should take two filenames as command-line arguments: 
	the source file (to read from) and the destination file (to write to).
	If the destination file already exists, the program should either overwrite it 
	or append to it based on a provided flag. Handle all errors gracefully and
	ensure proper file operations.

Key Concepts :
	- System calls (open(), read(), write(), close())
	- File descriptors
	- Error handling with errno
	- Command-line arguments
	- Buffer management

Architecture :
	- copy_file.c file with a single main function, no header file necessary

Compilation :
GCC with flags: -std=c99 -pedantic -Werror -Wall -Wextra -Wvla
